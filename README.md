Train a model that predicts runtime rankings for different tile configurations when executing machine learning models on TPUs. Since a machine learning model can be represented as a graph, with nodes being operations and edges being tensors, a GNN model can be trained to predict the execution times of different configurations and rank them accordingly. A detailed description of the problem is described in the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13490).
